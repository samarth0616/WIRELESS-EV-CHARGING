# WIRELESS-EV-CHARGING
This project, "Wireless EV Charging using Arduino," aims to design and implement a wireless charging system that can automatically detect a parked EV and initiate the charging process without human intervention. The system is controlled using an Arduino Uno, an hall sensor for vehicle detection, and a relay module to activate the charging coil.
